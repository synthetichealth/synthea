# applicability determines whether this mapping applies to a given file.
# for now the assumption is 1 file = 1 synthea patient bundle.
applicability: true
# for real mCODE: 
#   In FHIR terms, these are patients who have a Condition where 
#     Condition.code is a member of the value set [PrimaryOrUncertainBehaviorCancerDisorderVS] 
#     and 
#     Condition.verificationStatus is confirmed.

# reminder - the fhir_mapper for Synthea->mCODE 1.0 is here:
# https://github.com/standardhealth/fhir-mapper/blob/mcode1/src/mapping/mappers/SyntheaToV10.js

actions:
 - name: Apply Profiles
   # v1: define specific profiles and an applicability statement on when to apply them
   # v1.1: allow specifying a field from the profile to key off of (ex. mCode TNMPrimaryTumorCategory.code)
   # maybe v2 will automatically infer?
   # some of the challenges to keep in mind:
   #  - what if the resource doesn't conform to the profile yet? 
   #    we should make sure we can take other actions before applying profiles, 
   #    or manually specify where to apply profiles so that we can apply other fixes based on profile later.
