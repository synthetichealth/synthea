(e.g., concept not provided by required code system).<br/><br/>**Usage Notes**: This flavor and its specializations are most commonly used with the CD datatype and its flavors. However, it may apply to \\*any\\* datatype where the constraints of the type are tighter than can be conveyed. For example, a PQ that is for a true measured amount whose units are not supported in UCUM, a need to convey a REAL when the type has been constrained to INT, etc.<br/><br/>With coded datatypes, this null flavor may only be used if the vocabulary binding has a coding strength of CNE. By definition, all local codes and original text are part of the value set if the coding strength is CWE.</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"http://terminology.hl7.org/3.1.0/CodeSystem-v3-NullFlavor.html#v3-NullFlavor-UNK\">UNK</a></td><td>Unknown</td><td>**Description:**A proper value is applicable, but not known.<br/><br/>**Usage Notes**: This means the actual value is not known. If the only thing that is unknown is how to properly express the value in the necessary constraints (value set, datatype, etc.), then the OTH or UNC flavor should be used. No properties should be included for a datatype with this property unless:<br/><br/>1.  Those properties themselves directly translate to a semantic of &quot;unknown&quot;. (E.g. a local code sent as a translation that conveys 'unknown')<br/>2.  Those properties further qualify the nature of what is unknown. (E.g. specifying a use code of &quot;H&quot; and a URL prefix of &quot;tel:&quot; to convey that it is the home phone number that is unknown.)</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"http://terminology.hl7.org/3.1.0/CodeSystem-v3-NullFlavor.html#v3-NullFlavor-ASKU\">ASKU</a></td><td>Asked but no answer</td><td>Information was sought but not found (e.g., patient was asked but didn't know)</td></tr></table></li></ul></div>"},"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/ValueSet/us-core-sexual-orientation","version":"5.0.1","name":"USCoreSexualOrientation","title":"US Core Sexual Orientation","status":"active","date":"2022-06-01","publisher":"HL7 International - Cross-Group Projects","contact":[{"name":"HL7 International - Cross-Group Projects","telecom":[{"system":"url","value":"http://www.hl7.org/Special/committees/cgp"},{"system":"email","value":"cgp@lists.HL7.org"}]}],"description":"The US Core Sexual Orientation Value Set includes concepts to describe a person’s sexual orientation (who they are attracted to).","jurisdiction":[{"coding":[{"system":"urn:iso:std:iso:3166","code":"US"}]}],"copyright":"This value set includes content from SNOMED CT, which is copyright © 2002+ International Health Terminology Standards Development Organisation (IHTSDO), and distributed by agreement between IHTSDO and HL7.
