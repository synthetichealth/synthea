        "This drug blocks estrogen receptors on breast cancer cells. It stops estrogen from connecting to the cancer cells and telling them to grow and divide. While tamoxifen acts like an anti-estrogen in breast cells, it acts like an estrogen in other tissues, like the uterus and the bones. Because of this, it is called a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM).",

        "Tamoxifen can be used in several ways:",
        "",
        "For women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer treated with surgery, tamoxifen can help lower the chances of the cancer coming back and raise the chances of living longer. It can also lower the risk of getting a new cancer in the other breast. Tamoxifen can be started either after surgery (adjuvant therapy) or before surgery (neoadjuvant therapy) and is usually taken for 5 to 10 years. For early- stage breast cancer, this drug is mainly used for women who have not yet gone through menopause. (If you have gone through menopause, aromatase inhibitors are usually used instead.)",
        "For women who have been treated for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) that is hormone receptor-positive, taking tamoxifen for 5 years lowers the chance of the DCIS coming back. It also lowers the chance of getting an invasive breast cancer.",
        "For women with hormone-positive breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body, tamoxifen can often help slow or stop the growth of the cancer, and might even shrink some tumors.",
        "In women at high risk of breast cancer, tamoxifen can be used to help lower the risk of developing breast cancer.",
        "Toremifene (Fareston) is another SERM that works in a similar way, but it is used less often and is only approved to treat metastatic breast cancer. It is not likely to work if tamoxifen has already been used and has stopped working. These drugs are taken by mouth as a pill. The most common side effects of tamoxifen and toremifene are:",
        "",
        "Hot flashes",
        "Vaginal dryness or discharge",
        "Mood swings",
        "Some women with cancer spread to the bones may have a tumor flare with pain and swelling in the muscles and bones. This usually decreases quickly, but in some rare cases a woman may also develop a high calcium level in the blood that is hard to control. If this happens, the treatment may need to be stopped for a time.",
        "",
        "Rare, but more serious side effects are also possible:",
        "",
        "If a woman has gone through menopause, these drugs can increase her risk of developing uterine cancer . Tell your doctor right away about any unusual vaginal bleeding (a common symptom of both of these cancers). Most uterine bleeding is not from cancer, but this symptom always needs prompt attention.",
        "Blood clots are another uncommon, but serious side effect. They usually form in the legs (called deep vein thrombosis or DVT), but sometimes a piece of clot may break off and end up blocking an artery in the lungs (pulmonary embolism or PE). Call your doctor or nurse right away if you develop pain, redness, or swelling in your lower leg (calf), shortness of breath, or chest pain, because these can be symptoms of a DVT or PE.",
        "Rarely, tamoxifen has been associated with strokes in post-menopausal women, so tell your doctor if you have severe headaches, confusion, or trouble speaking or moving.",
        "Depending on a woman's menopausal status, tamoxifen can have different effects on the bones. In pre-menopausal women, tamoxifen can cause some bone thinning, but in post-menopausal women it is often good to strengthen bone. The benefits of taking these drugs outweigh the risks for almost all women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.",
