    "Gallstones are stones formed within the gallbladder (or common bile duct) due to an imbalance in the chemical composition of bile.  They can lead to inflammation and other issues with the gall bladder, the main bile duct, and the pancreas.  This model considers the most common process for surgical intervention for gallstones (due to a sudden onset of acute cholecystitis).",

    "- This model assumes that all cholecystectomies are due to cholecystitis, which is not necessarily true.  Many cholecystectomies are performed due to chronic cholelithiasis.  Prevalence data for cholelithiasis versus cholecystitis has not been found in scientific literature.",

    "- Subsequent or otherwise related procedures (e.g., ERCP) are not included.",
