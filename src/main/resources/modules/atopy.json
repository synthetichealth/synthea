    "4. Allergic Rhinitis (Hay Fever) ",
    "Okay... so maybe the atopic triad could be a 'quartet'.",
    "Up to 20% of children display signs of atopy, 50% by age 1 and 95% by age 5.",
    "75% of children with atopic symptoms outgrow them by adolescence or early ",
    "adulthood. However, 25% show symptoms for life. It is of course possible to be ",
    "non-atopic and still develop allergies and asthma.",
    "The prevalence of atopy and allergies has increased substantially in the 20th ",
    "century, especially after the 1960's, typically at a rate of 0.15 - 0.3% per ",
    "year. To model this historical increase in allergy prevalence atopy is the driving ",
    "factor. In this model the incidence of atopy increases at 1.875% per decade, or about ",
    "0.19% per year since 1940.",
