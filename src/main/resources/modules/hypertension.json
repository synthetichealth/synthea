    "The following model assumptions apply: ",
    "HTN Definitions: Our model definition of HTN is >= 140/90 for all populations, given general agreement of this threshold for pharmacotherapy across most clinical guidelines. Our model threshold for use of pharmacotherapy is SBP >= 140. We define control as SBP < 140. All individuals do NOT achieve control consistent with epidemiological studies. We acknowledge that HTN may be defined using a lower blood pressure (see ACC/AHA) and that lower pharmacotherapy thresholds and targets may be used for populations with certain comorbid conditions, cardiovascular risk, and/or of a certain age. This model does not reflect all primary HTN care pathways, as individual decision making that accounts for benefits, harms, treatment burden and other factors is a critical part of hypertension management. ",
    " ",
    "Pharmacotherapy: Pharmacotherapy represented in the submodule 'medications/hypertension_medication' includes ACE inhibitors/ angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), thiazide diuretics, and calcium channel blockers (CCB). The drug representing the pharmacologic category, is the medication most commonly prescribed, rather than the agent used in clinical trials (e.g. hydrochlorothiazide vs chlorthalidone). The use of an ACE-inhibitor is inclusive of the use of an ARB. The model only represents the use of dihydropyridine CCBs. Beta-blockers (BBs) are not represented in the model, as the use of BBs for hypertension management is often guided by other compelling clinical indications such as those noted in the clinical exclusions below. Additionally, evidence suggest that in populations without these comorbid conditions, beta‐blockers may not have the same benefits in preventing death and stroke as CCB, thiazides, and ACE/ARBS. The medication dose represented in the model represents the minimum dose of the usual dose range for HTN treatment. This medication dose is inclusive of a lower dose and/or titration to the maximum dose prior to adding another agent.",
    "",
    "Pathway: Once individuals require >= 4 medications for HTN treatment, their treatment is no longer represented in the model; these individuals meet the definition of resistant hypertension often requiring further evaluation and/or use of additional HTN medications. Evidence suggests this is a small percentage of individuals (~5-13%).",
    "",
    "Clinical Population Exclusions: The care pathway excludes individuals with ASCVD (e.g coronary heart disease, MI), heart failure, pregnancy, age < 18 years, or CKD > Stage III. Rationale: Recommendations for hypertension treatment differ in pregnancy due to risk of teratogenic effects with certain medications and associated pregnancy complications. In pediatrics, hypertension diagnosis is established based on age, sex, and height percentiles with limited evidence regarding long-term outcomes. For co-morbid cardiovascular conditions, we address hypertension management in current (or future) cardiovascular models since similar medications are used to manage cardiovascular disease and hypertension. For advanced CKD/ESRD, hypertension management pathways often differ with the use of additional medications. ",
