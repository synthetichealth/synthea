# List of input definitions for the model
# Field descriptions:
#   "from"              -   attribute or vital sign value to use directly from a Person.
#                           The "type" field must also be provided to specify which one.
#   "fromExp"           -   A mathematical expression. Both attributes and vital signs
#                           can be used within #{} blocks. The result will be assigned to
#                           the model input parameter indicated by "to".
#   "to"                -   Target model input parameter to assign
#   "varianceThreshold" -   Amount of variance to allow in the input parameter
#                           without performing a re-run of the simulation.
#                           This can significantly effect overall Synthea runtime.
#                           Defaults to 0.
#   "type"              -   Type of the input value "from", if applicable. Must be one of
#                           "ATTRIBUTE" or "VITAL_SIGN".

# List of output definitions for the model
# Field descriptions:
#   "from"              -   Model parameter to pull from directly.
#   "fromExp"           -   A mathematical expression. Any model parameter can be used
#                           within #{} blocks and will be a List of values for that
#                           parameter at each time step. The result will be assigned to
#                           the model input parameter indicated by "to".
#   "to"                -   Target Person attribute or vital sign to assign. Note that
#                           attributes are assigned as a side-effect of simulation
#                           execution, so the model must provide at least one vital sign
#                           output for the simulation to actually execute.
#   "varianceThreshold" -   Amount of variance to allow in the input parameter
#                           without performing a re-run of the simulation.
#                           This can significantly effect overall Synthea runtime.
#                           Defaults to 0.
#   "type"              -   Type of the output value "to". Must be "ATTRIBUTE" or "VITAL_SIGN".
