# Which differential equation solver to use.
# Options are: adams_bashforth, adams_moulton, dormand_prince_54, dormand_prince_853, euler, gragg_bulirsh_stoer, higham_hall_54, rosenbrock, runge_kutta

# Simulation step size in seconds. Note that this can have significant effects on the results and may impact the ability of the solver to complete successfully.
stepSize: 0.01

# Simulation duration in seconds
duration: 10

# Model parameter inputs. Any unspecified parameters will use the model's default value.
inputs:
    hrmean: 80

# What charts to draw. Results will be plotted on PNG images.
# Note that chart support is a convenience feature and many chart options cannot be manipulated here.
# If you need more control over the chart, import the csv file into another program with that capability.
