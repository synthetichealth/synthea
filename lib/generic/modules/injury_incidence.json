    "This module computes the incidence for a variety of injuries. This module ",

    " 'injured'      - boolean - Indicates if an injury occured and triggers the injuries ",
    "                            module to process that injury. ",
    " 'injury_type'  - string  - Indicates the type of injury. See supported types below. ",
    " 'fatal_injury' - boolean - Indicates if the injury is fatal (only applies to some ",
    "                            injuries, see below).",

    "Supported injury types are: ",
    "1.  'spinal'       - injuries to the spinal cord or fractures of the spine ",
    "2.  'gunshot'      - gunshot wounds ",
